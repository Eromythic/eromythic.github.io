A couple of years ago I ran a D&D5e one shot for a group of friends. I'll be sharing it here for those interested. The key points would be:
+ Flexible player count (3 to 6 player characters)
+ Rules-light, meant for roleplay with new players (players say what they want and DM figures out the how-to's).
+ Fairy Tale feel, characters are gnomes that live in shrooms, the inciting event is a missing cake (that being said, there's combat).

So, with the dry stuff out of the way, here's the opening of the game:

*On the morrow is the anniversary of the university’s founding, so you all go to sleep excited about the coming festivities.*

*Suddenly, you are all awoken by a mental message from the Archdeacon: “The Cake!”. It’s not even daybreak, so it takes you some time to process it but you all come to the same conclusion: something must have happened to the cake that was supposed to highlight tomorrow’s feast!*

*You hurriedly jump out of your pajamas into your work-clothes and head towards the University.*

### Player Characters ###

The players were given pre-made characters to choose from, based on their descriptions. Of course if they have questions about their details they can be answered freely but the point is to not overwhelm with (mostly unnecessary) information. The character list looked like this:
+ **Dean of Divination:** Specialized in Divination magic. Has detection skills and spells as well as some ability to fudge dice in your favor.
+ **Dean of Wilderness:** Specialized in Nature magic. Has outdoor skills and spells and is good at melee combat.
+ **Dean of Defense:** Specialized in Abjuration magic. Has healing skills and spells and is good at protecting itself from enemy magic.
+ **Dean of Offense:** Specialized in Evocation magic. Is good at magic combat and elemental effects.
+ **Dean of Conjuration:** Specialized in Conjuration magic. Has specialized knowledge of the occult, can conjure up new objects and creatures for both every-day use as well as combat.
+ **Dean of Wellness:** Specialized in Muscle magic. Has physical skills and spells and is good at melee combat.
+ **Dean of Lore:** Specialized in the Scriptures. Has great knowledge of many things and useful spells for gathering information.
+ **Dean of Artifice:** Specialized in Runic magic. Has crafting and investigation skills. His spells are a mixture of utility and explosions and is good at ranged combat.

At this stage they were also introduced to their remaining faculty members:
+ **Archdean Supreme (NPC):** No one knows if they have any specialization, they are seemingly good at everything!!
+ **Dean of Illusion (NPC):** Specialized in Illusion magic. Is good at playing tricks on others.
+ **Dean of Mushrooms (NPC):** Specialized in Necromantic magic. Has specialized knowledge of the occult, can raise pet mushrooms to perform different tasks.

### Other Preparations ###

I printed a cutesy fairy-looking character sheet and filled it in for each possible character they might pick, and I also had prints for their spell lists with the full description of each. That way as soon as characters were chosen, the players had everything they needed to start. Everything put together ended up amounting to more work than I initially thought. It wasn't an inordinate amount, but certainly more than expected.

### Post-Game Feelings ###

There's some spoilers from here on, so be warned. 

I didn't actually sit to write down my thoughts on how things went at the time, so I'm left scrambling to remember now. In the end we had 4 players and I'm pretty sure that the Dean of Lore, the Dean of Wellness and the Dean of Artifice saw play. 

The bits of the game that revolved around investigation and navigating the environment developed pretty well. There was a bunch of improvisation due to unexpected avenues of investigation but that's to be expected.

The combat was a bigger obstacle than I would have liked and I would probably recommend removing the first encounter with the slimes entirely. The shamblers ended up being a much bigger threat than anticipated, but the adventure felt all the more perilous for it; so I would keep them. I would probably lower their HP, though. I'm pretty sure I ended up adjusting it on-the-go so the fight could end on a high note without being dragged. 

The finale was fun, and having exorcising the bad men as win con that doesn't necessarily involve fighting anyone felt good. It is specially interesting if there's more than one enemy and they have limited means to exorcise, so they have to heal one while fighting the other or some such. The script is very dry on detail at the end regarding what the "boss encounter" looks like, how things ended up like that, motivation, etc. At the time I settled on: the Illusionist and the Necromancer wanted to eat the cake by themselves, and they go this old abandoned building to do it undisturbed. On the way they find some mushrooms they eat as appetizers, and through the shrooms they get possessed. Ideally the players learn about the possession at some point during the fight and come up with ways to handle it that don't involve fighting (or not only). Removing the possession with dispel and then casting protection against evil might be a way, but there may be others they come up with. The more roleplay and creativity involved the better!
